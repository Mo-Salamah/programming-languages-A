# Programming Languages- Part A

Solutions to the homework assignments of the MOOC on Coursera.

In taking this course I solidified and deepened my understanding of some fundamental programming concepts present in every language. The usage of a little-used programming language, Standard ML, is used to emphasize the universality of these concepts. 

Topics: 
1. Syntax vs. semantics vs. idioms vs. libraries vs. tools 
2. ML basics (bindings, conditionals, records, functions) 
3. Recursive functions and recursive types
4. Algebraic datatypes, pattern matching
5. Higher-order functions; closures 
6. Lexical scope
7. Currying
8. Syntactic sugar
9. Equivalence and effects
10. Parametric polymorphism and container types
11. Type inference
12. Abstract types and modules
13. Scheme basics
14. Dynamic vs. static typing
15. Laziness and memoization
16. Implementing higher-order functions
17. Macros
18. Abstract types via dynamic type-creation
